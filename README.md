# About Me:

I am a manual tester with two years of experience in IT and an ISTQB Foundation Level certificate. I started my career with the Dare IT Challenge, where I tested the Futbolkolektyw app for football players. I am focused on growth – I eagerly take part in additional projects, including hobby and pro bono initiatives, to expand my knowledge and skills. <br><br>

## My main Gallup strengths are:

### Input<br>
I like to know as much as possible – I read documentation, gather information, and note interesting cases and solutions. This helps me quickly adapt to new projects and ask the right questions to identify issues.<br><br>

### Intellection<br>
I spend a lot of time thinking, analyzing, and diving deep into topics. In testing, this allows me to break down problems, look for connections, and consider the broader context. I don’t settle for surface-level checks – I look for root causes and dependencies.<br><br>

### Individualization<br>
I notice that everyone in a team is different. I can adjust my communication and approach to different people, which makes cooperation easier – both with developers and clients. It also helps me better understand end users’ needs.<br><br>

### Learner<br>
I have a strong need for development. I quickly learn new tools and technologies and eagerly take part in trainings and side projects. Thanks to this, I can introduce new solutions and raise the quality of testing.<br><br>

### Competition<br>
Competition motivates me to set ambitious goals and constantly improve my work. I like to see tangible results and strive to make every project polished and valuable for the team and users.<br><br>
