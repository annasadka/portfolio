# About Me:

I am a manual tester with two years of experience in IT and an ISTQB Foundation Level certificate. I started my career with the Dare IT Challenge, where I tested the Futbolkolektyw app for football players. I am focused on growth – I eagerly take part in additional projects, including hobby and pro bono initiatives, to expand my knowledge and skills. <br><br>

## My main Gallup strengths are:

✅ Input - I quickly gather and organize information, which helps me adapt to new projects and ask the right questions during testing.

✅ Intellection - I analyze problems deeply and look for connections, always aiming to find the root cause rather than just surface-level issues.<br>

✅ Individualization - I adjust my communication to different team members, making collaboration smoother and better understanding user needs.<br>

✅ Learner - I’m eager to learn new tools and technologies, which allows me to introduce improvements and raise testing quality.<br>

✅ Competition - I set ambitious goals for myself and strive to deliver polished, valuable results for the team and users.<br>

<br><br>
# Work experience: 
After completing the Dare IT Challenge, where I tested the Futbolkolektyw app for football players, I started an internship at TestArmy. There, I was responsible for manual testing of web applications, preparing test scenarios and documentation.

Later, I joined ennovative as a Software Tester, where I tested project and event management applications. My main responsibilities included designing and executing manual tests, reporting bugs, and maintaining test documentation. I also created and maintained automated tests in Cypress using TypeScript, analyzed test results, and worked closely with developers and other testers to identify and solve issues. This role allowed me to significantly deepen my knowledge of both manual and automated testing in a dynamic, agile environment
